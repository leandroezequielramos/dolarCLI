<summary>Prerequisites</summary>

<details>
<summary>1. Set up Git to use SSH</summary>

1. [Generate an SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent#generating-a-new-ssh-key) and [add the SSH key to your GitHub account](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account).
1. Configure SSH to automatically load your SSH keys:
    ```sh
    cat << EOF >> ~/.ssh/config
    Host *
      AddKeysToAgent yes
      IgnoreUnknown UseKeychain
      UseKeychain yes
    EOF
    ```

<details>
<summary>2. Install Docker</summary>

1. [Install Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/get-started).
    - Enable _Use Docker Compose V2_ in Docker Desktop's preferences window.
    - _Linux only_:
        - Export your user's user id and group id so that [files created in the Dev Container are owned by your user](https://github.com/moby/moby/issues/3206):
            ```sh
            cat << EOF >> ~/.bashrc
            export UID=$(id --user)
            export GID=$(id --group)
            export POETRY_AUTH_TOML_PATH="~/.config/pypoetry/auth.toml"
            EOF
            ```
    - _Windows only_:
        - Export the location of your private package repository credentials so that Docker Compose can load these as a [build and run time secret](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#secrets-configuration-reference):
            ```bat
            setx POETRY_AUTH_TOML_PATH %APPDATA%\pypoetry\auth.toml
            ```

</details>

<details>
<summary>3. Install VS Code or PyCharm</summary>

1. [Install VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [VS Code's Dev Containers extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers). Alternatively, install [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/).
2. _Optional:_ install a [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) such as [FiraCode Nerd Font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/tree/master/patched-fonts/FiraCode) and [configure VS Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/VS-Code-Instructions) or [configure PyCharm](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode/wiki/Intellij-products-instructions) to use it.

</details>

<details>
<summary>4. Configure Poetry to use the private package repository</summary>

1. [Add your private package repository credentials to your Poetry's `auth.toml` file](https://python-poetry.org/docs/repositories/#configuring-credentials):
    ```toml
    # Linux:   ~/.config/pypoetry/auth.toml
    # macOS:   ~/Library/Application Support/pypoetry/auth.toml
    # Windows: C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\pypoetry\auth.toml
